                    Dolby Atmos is an innovative audio technology that envelops you in an immersive listening experience. While music mixed in stereo is limited to left and right channels, music created in Dolby Atmos is freed from channels, allowing artists to place individual sounds all around you. Artists can also decide the volume, size and vibrancy of each instrument to reveal nuanced details in the music.
